          Iâ€™m a developer passionate about building seamless, scalable, and
          accessible full-stack applications that blend thoughtful design with
          robust engineering. I thrive at the intersection of front-end and
          back-end development, crafting experiences that are not only visually
          engaging but also optimized for performance, security, and
          maintainability.

          In my previous role as a Senior Consultant Developer at Thoughtworks,
          I designed, developed, and maintained software systems across diverse
          environments. My work spanned front-end development with React and
          Vue.js, back-end development with Spring and Flask, database
          management with SQL, data processing using the ELK stack and
          Terraforming on AWS, Azure, and GCP.
        </p>

          I collaborated with clients from various industries, including
          e-commerce, automotive, and big data analytics. Most of my experience
          comes from working alongside the talented teams at Thoughtworks and
          their clients. Through this, I gained a deep appreciation for agile
          software development methodologies, clean code, TDD, pair-programming
          and facilitating effective group discussions.

          Outside of work, I enjoy playing chess, reading, spending time with my
          friends, and going for a run.
